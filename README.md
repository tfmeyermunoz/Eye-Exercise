# Eye-Exercise

This repository includes the work done during Week 8 of the MIT JavaScript course 2021. a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. The Eye Movement activity requires you to bring together your skills in JavaScript and CSS to create this dynamic experience.


## Title of the project: 

Eye Movement Animation Project of Tomás Meyer

## Brief project description:

This repository is intended to include all the work done at the coding activity at week 8 of the MIT JavaScript course. The repository structure is divided into
HTML and CCS, which include:

- eyes.html. The file that organizes my CSS and HTML codes into one file.
- eyes.ccs. The file where I define the styles I will be using in my webpage.

## How to run:

1. First of all, you need to go to the repository at the following direction: .
2. Download all the files included in the repository.
4. Open the eyes.html file in your favourite browser and move the mouse to see the eyes movement animation.
5. In case you want to change the styling of the animation, modify the eyes.css file.

## Next steps:

It would be wonderful to add more human body parts to the Eye Movement Exercise. For example, I would like to add the following:

1. A mouth that shows either a smile or an angry face if you click on a "mood" button.
2. The alternative to choose the eye colour.
3. Figure out other human movements.
